  ASSET_BASE: '../assets-v2/flying-dungeon/',

  // --- Canvas: fixed internal resolution (matches the main game) ----------
  GAME_W: 1280,
  GAME_H: 720,           // CSS-scaled to the window with letterboxing

  // --- Background: the orbiting fruit tray --------------------------------
  // The frame is drawn 1:1 at its (reduced) resolution — LARGER than the
  // 1280×720 canvas — so the canvas shows a cropped WINDOW into it. The camera
  // pans that window with the plane, in both axes, revealing the rest of the
  // tray. FRAME_CAP is therefore both the texture resolution AND the world
  // size: raise it to see a smaller/zoomed piece (more room to pan, more VRAM),
  // lower it to see more of the tray at once (less VRAM).
  FRAMES: 16,            // camera angles
  FRAME_W: 3784,         // native frame size (all frames share it)
  FRAME_H: 3800,
  FRAME_CAP: 1600,       // downscale longest side to this on load = world size
  frameMs: 60,           // ms per sharp angle
  blurMs: 24,            // ms per blurred (-B) transition frame
  withBlur: true,        // interleave the -B frames
  dupFrames: true,       // each frame twice → smoother cadence
  defaultReverse: true,  // free-run order before the player takes control

  // --- Player plane -------------------------------------------------------
  CHARACTERS: ['lemon', 'tomato', 'eggplant'],
  CH_FRAMES: 6,          // pitch poses per character
  CH_REST: 3,            // level pose (0-based frame 4)
  planeScale: 0.32 * 0.6, // plane height as a fraction of the stage height (60% of prior)
  tiltMs: 110,           // ms per pitch-pose step
  moveSpeed: 0.30,       // vertical speed, stage-fraction / sec
  startX: 0.49,          // pinned horizontal position
  startY: 0.90,

  // --- Float bob (same sine as the loading letters, +20% freq) ------------
  bobFreq: 2.52,         // rad/sec
  bobRel: 0.05,          // amplitude ÷ sprite height
  bobMin: 6,             // px floor

  // --- Machine gun --------------------------------------------------------
  GUN_FRAMES: 6,
  fireMs: 70,            // ms per muzzle-flash frame while firing
  // Flash offsets are in px, TUNED at gunOffRefScale. render() rescales them by
  // planeScale/gunOffRefScale so they track the plane's size automatically —
  // change planeScale and the flash stays glued to the nose, no re-tuning.
  gunOffRefScale: 0.32,  // the planeScale the offsets below were dialled in at
  gunOffX: 12,           // px toward the plane (closes the nose gap)
  gunOffY: 5,            // px upward, level pose only (aligns with the muzzle)
