     THE BELT
     =========================================================================
     A belt-scroller's world is (x, z): x runs along the level, z is DEPTH
     across the walkable strip. Jump height is a third value that is drawn but
     never simulated in world space — see `Fighter.jumpY`.

         screenX = x - camX
         screenY = beltTopY + z - jumpY

     z is in SCREEN PIXELS, not an abstract 0..1, and that is deliberate: it
     makes `beltDepth` directly readable as "how tall is the walkable strip on
     screen", and it makes the depth half of a hitbox comparable with the
     horizontal half without a conversion factor sitting between them.

     z = 0 is the FAR edge (back wall), z = beltDepth is the NEAR edge. Draw
     order is z ascending, so bigger z draws later and therefore in front.

     ⚠️ THE BELT IS A LANE DEFINED OVER THE PLATE, NOT DERIVED FROM IT. The
     background is one photograph and knows nothing about where a fighter may
     stand; these two numbers are the whole of that agreement, and they are the
     ONLY thing that has to be re-measured when the real footage is cut in —
     read the ground band off a frame of the shot and set them to it. Everything
     else (hit tests, draw sorting, the camera, the AI) is expressed in z and
     follows automatically.

     They are what stops the player walking up off the floor and into the
     scenery, which stays true whatever the plate turns out to be. */

     THE LAYER STACK
     =========================================================================
     Rendering is an ORDERED LIST rather than a fixed back-to-front sequence in
     the renderer, because a foreground plane in front of everything was asked
     for on day one and more layers are likely once the filmed backdrop lands.
     Adding one is an entry here; it is never surgery in the draw code.

     `source` names a backdrop source registered in backdrop.js.
     `parallax` is px of layer movement per px of camera movement: below 1 the
     layer lags behind (far away), above 1 it outruns the camera (close to the
     lens, which is what sells a foreground).
     `entities: true` is the slot the fighters are drawn in, z-sorted. Exactly
     one layer should carry it. */
  LAYERS: [
    /* ⚠️ ONE PLATE, NOT A BACKDROP PLUS A FLOOR, AND THIS IS LOAD-BEARING.
       The filmed background is a SINGLE SHOT: the far scenery and the ground
       the fighters stand on are the same photograph, baked together by the
       camera that took it. There is no seam between them and nothing to slide
       one against the other.

       This started as two tiled layers at 0.35 and 1.0 parallax, and it was
       wrong for exactly that reason — the moment real footage arrived, the
       "backdrop" half would have been a second copy of a shot that already
       contains its own floor, sliding underneath it. It is one layer at
       parallax 1.0 now, so when the plate becomes a film the ONLY change is
       `kind: 'tile'` → `kind: 'film'` in SOURCES.

       Parallax 1.0 is also the only honest value for a plate: a real camera
       move already carries its own parallax inside the frame. Anything else

  /* --- Backdrop sources ---------------------------------------------------
     A source answers draw(ctx, scrollX, w, h) and nothing else, so the level
     never knows whether it is looking at a tile, a painting or a film. Three
     kinds exist:

       tile   an image repeated forever in x (and optionally y)
       image  one long painted strip
       film   a FRAME SEQUENCE — the filmed backdrop this game is heading for

     ⚠️ THE FILM SOURCE IS THE POINT OF THIS INDIRECTION. The plan is to shoot
     real footage and cut it in, and footage behaves differently from a
     painting: it has its own time. So a film source runs in one of two modes,
     and which one is chosen by the SEGMENT it is playing under (see SEGMENTS):

       scrub  the frame is indexed by CAMERA POSITION. Walking right winds the
              footage forward — the camera is travelling, so the film travels.
              This is what a scrolling section wants.
       play   the frame is indexed by TIME, looping. The camera is locked and
              the world is alive around a fight. This is what an arena wants.

     Neither mode exists in the other's segment, which is why the mode is not
     configured here: `stage.js` sets it from the segment kind. */

     THE LEVEL
     =========================================================================
     A beat 'em up level is a SEQUENCE OF SEGMENTS, alternating between walking
     and fighting. That structure is the genre's spine and it is also exactly
     what was asked for: parts where the background moves, parts where it is
     static.

       scroll  the camera follows the player rightward and the level plays like
               a walk. Nothing gates the player except the segment's end.
       arena   THE CAMERA LOCKS. A wall goes up at each edge of the view, the
               listed enemies spawn, and neither the camera nor the player may
               leave until every one of them is down.

     `toX` is the world x at which a scroll segment hands over. For an arena it
     is the camera's locked position, and the walls are derived from it — one
     number rather than three that can disagree.

     Enemy entries are { kind, x, z, delayMs }. x/z are WORLD coords; for an
     arena they are usually written relative to the lock, but they are absolute
     here so a segment can be moved by editing one number and nothing else. */
  /* ⚠️ NO `camX` ON THE ARENAS, ON PURPOSE — each locks wherever the camera had
     got to when the scroll before it handed over, which can never disagree with
     that scroll. Enemy x's below are written against where that lands.

     The camera trails the player by the focus point plus the deadzone, so a
     scroll ending at `toX` leaves the camera at roughly
     `toX - (GAME_W*camFocusX + camDeadzone)` — about 670px back at the current
     tuning — and the view is the 1280 to the right of that. Retune the camera
     and these enemy positions want re-checking; the arena lock does not,

     from the camera, because a fighter turning its back on the player breaks
     the read of who is about to hit whom. That leaves rows 1-3 —

       startup   wind-up. NO hitbox. This is the window an opponent can see the
                 blow coming and get out of it, and it is what stops a fight
                 being a contest of who mashed first.
       active    the hitbox is live. Short, because a long active window lets
                 one punch sweep a room.
       recover   committed, cannot act. What LOSING a trade costs.
       cancel    a window, measured from the start of `active`, in which
                 pressing attack again advances the combo instead of being
                 dropped. Wider than the active window on purpose: a player who
                 presses on the frame the punch lands should be heard.

     ⚠️ `reachZ` IS THE ONE THAT MAKES THIS A BEAT 'EM UP. A punch has to line
     up in DEPTH as well as distance, and the size of that tolerance is the
     whole difficulty dial of the genre — too tight and the game is a fight
